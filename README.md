# APICO-API-GML
When you call one of the API methods in the APICO [Modding API](https://wiki.apico.buzz/wiki/Modding_API) you are actually just directly calling a GML script inside GameMaker.

These repo contains all the GML scripts for each of the API methods - it's here in case you want to double check the arguments or an error, there might be an issue with the documentation, or maybe just curious!

Pls don't judge me I wrote all of this code in mostly 2 days straight through a haze of caffeine
